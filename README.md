This Power BI project was developed during my internship to convert raw organizational data into a fully interactive and visually intuitive dashboard. It includes dynamic charts, KPIs, slicers, and drill-through pages that help stakeholders analyze performance trends, track key business metrics, and make data-driven decisions. I worked on data cleaning, modeling, creating DAX measures, and designing user-friendly visualizations that improved reporting efficiency and offered clear insights into operational performance. The dashboard updates automatically and provides a streamlined view of the most important indicators for the business.
